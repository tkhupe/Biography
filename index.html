      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone, I am a young man who moved to the United States from Zimbabwe in  December 2002. 
        I left home on Christmas day and landed in Dallas Fort Worth the next day. After spending a couple of weeks 
        in Denton I moved to Marshall TX where I began my first semester of college. At Wiley College, 
        I studied for a Bachelor's degree in Biology and a Bachelor's degree in Secondary Education.
        After spending a year of practical training as a 9th grade science teacher, I then moved to Oklahoma City to embark on 
        prospects to read for a Bachelor's of Science in Nurse at the 
        Kramer School of Nursing, of the Oklahoma City University. 
        After an unsuccessful attempt to complete my enrollment at the University of Oklahoma's Health Science Center due to 
        funding I was forced to seek refuge in the streets of Austin as a homeless wayfarer. 
        This in my perspective would become an integral an pivotal period of my life.
         </p>
      <h1>Who are you</h1>
      <p>Wow, I think that is a very important question. I am constantly battling myself to 
        answer that question to myself in part because I believe the is more than what meets the eye that 
        constitutes the holistic persona one ultimately portrays. I am my beliefs and I am my actions
      and I am also how I reconcile the many aspects of my experiences and transliterate them into some representation
    and projection. But most importantly I am a seeker and I believe I would like that to be my legacy.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love music, chess, tennis, gardening, walking my dogs, and table-tennis, learning.</p>
      <h1>What's are your dreams?</h1>
      <p>I never stop dreaming, and I always believe that each of them are aspects of each other. I think when I chase after one goal 
        its only a part of reaching the next so I can never pin point a specific singular as my dream rather a 
        union of events, beliefs and time are what I long for. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Austin Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning new ways of solving day to day problems I want to learn new ways of changing
        my past mistakes.

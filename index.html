      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone, I am a young man who moved to the United States from Zimbabwe in  December 2002. 
        I left home on Christmas day and landed in Dallas Fort Worth the next day. After spending a couple of weeks 
        in Denton I moved to Marshall TX where I began my first semester of college. At Wiley College, 
        I studied for a Bachelor's degree in Biology and a Bachelor's degree in Secondary Education.
        After spending a year of practical training as a 9th grade science teacher, I then moved to Oklahoma City to embark on 
        prospects to read for a Bachelor's of Science in Nurse at the 
        Kramer School of Nursing, of the Oklahoma City University. 
        After an unsuccessful attempt to complete my enrollment at the University of Oklahoma's Health Science Center due to 
        funding I was forced to seek refuge in the streets of Austin as a homeless wayfarer. 
        This in my perspective would become an integral an pivotal period of my life.
         </p>
